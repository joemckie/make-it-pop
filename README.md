"Make it Pop"
=============

Designers hate when clients ask for a site that 'pops'. Well, now you can deliver!

You can test this by doing the Konami Code - `up up, down down, left right left right, b a, enter`, for those that can't remember it, on [this site](http://joemck.ie/)

How to install
==============

Include konami.js and make-it-pop.js in the `<head>` tag. Do the konami code!
